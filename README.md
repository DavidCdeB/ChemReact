# CheSRMI: Chemical Speciation and Reaction Mechanisms Identification

The workflow of codes in this repository allow for the identification of species and reaction mechanisms (*open* and *closed* reactions) given an input trajectory as explained in Ref. [1]

*In progress:* detailed documentation for user-friendly use.
